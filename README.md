# AQI-PREDICTION
using machine learning supervised learning  and ann

I have used 5 algorithms
1.Linear Regression
2.Lasso Regrresion
3.Decision tree
4.Knn
5.ANN

Steps involved 
1.I uploaded the dataset
2.Find the null values.
3.Find the releation between the features using heatmap,pairplot
4.Printed the features importance 
5.Then divied the dateset in train and test split with 30%test size.
6.Applied the algorithms
7.Tried to find the best result by doing tuning of parameter for example In knn we find best value n_neighbour
8.After apply the algorithms we applied different evaluation metrics like mean absolute error etc.
9.finded the best algorithms.
